If you enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error
For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label"
For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see placeholder text that gives a description or instructions for each field
